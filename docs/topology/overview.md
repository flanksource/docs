# Topology

![](../images/topology-overview.svg)

Topology is a way for you to describe the different parts of your infrastructure, like  servers, databases, applications, or any other elements that make up your system, in a structured way. It is represented as a tree-like structure where the nodes are called Components.

The Components in a Topology can reference each other, which allows you to create a more complex and interconnected topology. This makes it easy to visualize how different parts of your infrastructure are related to each other and how they interact with each other. For example, you can have a database component that is referenced by multiple server components, indicating that these servers are all dependent on the database.

Users can provide the Topology structure as a YAML specification, which is a simple way to represent data in a human-readable format. With this specification, users can create a clear and detailed description of their system infrastructure, allowing them to easily manage and maintain their systems.
