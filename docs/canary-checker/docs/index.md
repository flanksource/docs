Canary checker is a kubernetes-native platform for monitoring health across application and infrastructure using both passive and active (synthetic) mechanisms.

## Features

* **Batteries Included** - 35+ built-in check types
* **Kubernetes Native** - Health checks (or canaries) are CRD's that reflect health via the `status` field, making them compatible with GitOps, [Flux Health Checks](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#health-checks), Argo, Helm, etc..
* **Secret Management** - Leverage K8S secrets and configmaps for authentication and connection details
* **Prometheus** - Prometheus compatible metrics are exposed at `/metrics`.  A Grafana Dashboard is also available.
* **Dependency Free** - Runs an embedded postgres instance by default,  can also be configured to use an external database.
* **JUnit Export (CI/CD)**  - Export health check results to JUnit format for integration into CI/CD pipelines
* **JUnit Import (k6/newman/puppeter/etc)** - Use any container that creates JUnit test results
* **Scriptable** - Go templates, Javascript and [Expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) can be used to:
  * Evaluate whether a check is passing and severity to use when failing
  * Extract a user friendly error message
  * Transform and filter check responses into individual check results
* **Multi-Modal** - While designed as a Kubernetes Operator, canary checker can also run as a CLI and a server without K8s

## Use Cases

* **Synthetic Monitoring**

* **Unified Alerting**



### When not to use

* Browser based testing
* 



## Getting Started

1. Install canary checker:

  ```shell
  helm repo add flanksource https://flanksource.github.io/charts
  helm repo update
  helm install canary-checker
  ```

2. Create a new check:

  ```yaml title="canary.yaml"
  apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
  kind: Canary
  metadata:
    name: http-check
  spec:
    interval: 30
    http:
      - name: basic-check
        url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/200
      - name: failing-check
        url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/500
  ```

2a. Run the check locally (Optional)

```shell
canary-checker run canary.yaml
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f canary.yaml
```

3. Check the status of the health check:

```shell
kubectl get canary
```
