Canary checker is a kubernetes-native platform for monitoring health across application and infrastructure using both passive and active (synthetic) mechanisms.

## Features

* **Batteries Included** - 35+ built-in check types
* **Kubernetes Native** - Health checks (or canaries) are CRD's that reflect health via the `status` field, making them compatible with GitOps, [Flux Health Checks](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#health-checks), Argo, Helm, etc..
* **Secret Management** - Leverage K8S secrets and configmaps for authentication and connection details
* **Prometheus** - Prometheus compatible metrics are exposed at `/metrics`.  A Grafana Dashboard is also available.
* **Dependency Free** - Runs an embedded postgres instance by default,  can also be configured to use an external database.
* **JUnit Export (CI/CD)**  - Export health check results to JUnit format for integration into CI/CD pipelines
* **JUnit Import (k6/newman/puppeter/etc)** - Use any container that creates JUnit test results
* **Scriptable** - Go templates, Javascript and [Expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) can be used to:
  * Evaluate whether a check is passing and severity to use when failing
  * Extract a user friendly error message
  * Transform and filter check responses into individual check results
* **Multi-Modal** - While designed as a Kubernetes Operator, canary checker can also run as a CLI and a server without K8s

Canary Checker can collect health about systems in few different ways:

* **Active** **Application** health checks involve sending periodic requests to the service or application and checking the response to ensure that it is working correctly,  Active health checks are proactive and can detect issues quickly, but they can also introduce some load on the system being monitored.
* **Active Infrastructure** health checks are similar to application health checks, but instead of sending a request to the application it sends a request to the infrastructure to deploy a new application or infrastructure component e.g. a new Kubernetes pod or EC2 instance.
* **Passive** health checks rely on monitoring the activity in the system, analysing it, and detecting anomalies or errors. Passive health checks are less intrusive than active health checks, but they may not detect issues as quickly.

Health checks can be defined in 3 different ways:

1. **UI**: Navigate to Settings --> Health --> Click on the :material-plus-circle: button
1. **[GitOps](./concepts/gitops.md)** canary-checker is fully Gitops enabled using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)
1. **[CLI](./tutorials/run.md)** For rapid development and feedback, canary-checker can be run as a normal CLI application by specifying the health check definition in a config file.
