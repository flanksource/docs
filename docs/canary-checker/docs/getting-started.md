# Getting Started

1. Install canary checker:

  ```bash
  helm repo add flanksource https://flanksource.github.io/charts
  helm repo update
  helm install canary-checker
  ```

2. Create a new check

  ```yaml title="canary.yaml"
  apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
  kind: Canary
  metadata:
    name: http-check
  spec:
    interval: 30
    http:
      - name: basic-check
        url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/200
      - name: failing-check
        url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/500
  ```

  And then apply it to the cluster:

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f canary.yaml
  ```

  :::info
  You can also run the check locally to see its output by using the [cli](./cli)

  ```bash
  canary-checker run canary.yaml
  ```

  <Asciinema id="594517" width="850px"/>
  :::

3. Check the status of the health check:

  ```shell
  kubectl get canary
  ```

  <Asciinema id="tXluDS5sH68gVdko4qctIZEC1"/>
