### Connecting to AWS

There are 3 options when connecting to AWS:

1. An AWS [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) or [pod identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-configuration.html) (the default if no `connection` or `accessKey` is specified)
2. `connection`, this is the recommended method, connections are reusable and secure

    ```yaml title="aws-connection.yaml"
    apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
    kind: Canary
    metadata:
      name: cloudwatch-check
    spec:
      interval: 30
      cloudwatch:
        - connection: connection://aws/internal
          region: us-east-1 # optional if specified in the connection
    ```

3. `accessKey` and `secretKey` [*EnvVar*](../../concepts/authentication/#envvar) with the credentials stored in a secret.

    ```yaml title="aws.yaml"
    apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
    kind: Canary
    metadata:
      name: cloudwatch-check
    spec:
      interval: 30
      cloudwatch:
        - accessKey:
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: aws-credentials
                key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          secretKey:
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: aws-credentials
                key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
          region: us-east-1
    ```
