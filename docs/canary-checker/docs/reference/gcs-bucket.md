### Connecting to GCP

There are 3 options when connecting to GCP:

1. GKE [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) (the default if no `connection` or `credentials` is specified)
2. `connection`, this is the recommended method, connections are reusable and secure

```yaml title="aws-connection.yaml"
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: database-backup-check
spec:
  interval: 60
  folder:
      - name: gcs auth test
        path: gcs://somegcsbucket
        gcpConnection:
        connection: connection://gcp/internal
```

3. `accessKey` and `secretKey` [*EnvVar*](../../concepts/authentication/#envvar) with the credentials stored in a secret.

```yaml title="aws.yaml"
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: database-backup-check
spec:
  interval: 60
  folder:
      - name: gcs auth test
        path: gcs://somegcsbucket
        gcpConnection:
          credentials:
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: gcp-credentials
                key: AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN

```
