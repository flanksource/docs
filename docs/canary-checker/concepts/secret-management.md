# Secret Management with Kubernetes Secrets
[Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) are secure objects which store sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, or keys. This information can be attached to a Pod or container image that may require the information to operate. With Kubernetes Secrets, it provides a means to attach confidential data into your application.
In this guide, you will see how to create a Kubernetes secret, attach it to your application or service you want to run.
## Create Sample Kubernetes Secret
For this section, to experience Kubernetes secrets management in action you'll create a sample Kubernetes Secret which contains your AWS credentials such as `AccessKey` and `SecretAccessKey`. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html) for more information on obtaining AWS credentials.
With your credentials obtained, perform the following commands to create a Kubernetes secret containing your AWS credentials:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> \ 
--from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<aws_access_key_id>" \ 
--from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<aws_secret_access_key>"
```
View the contents of your generated secret with the following command:
```bash
# Get content for secret
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data}'

# Decode secret
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}' | base64 --decode
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}' | base64 --decode
```
Output:
```console
{"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID":"<base-64-encoded-aws_access_key_id>","AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY":"<base-64-encoded-aws_secret_access_key>"}
```
The steps above can be used to create Kubernetes secrets for other credentials, such as ElasticSearch, Docker, Helm, and more.

## Recommendations
Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with API access can retrieve or modify a Secret, and so can anyone with access to etcd. With this in mind, it is recommended to implement some level of security to prevent unauthorized access to your Kubernetes secrets.
