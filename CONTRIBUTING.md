Use the [Google Technical Docs Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/)

# Tone

- Use [second-person](https://developers.google.com/style/person) pronouns (you, your) with an [active](https://developers.google.com/style/voice) voice, in the [present](https://developers.google.com/style/tense) tense

# Duplicate

1. Prefer duplication to referencing where possible - it makes it easier for humands and AI to read.

# Formatting

1. Use **Menu** â†’ **Submenu**

# Sections

1. Use short section / step titles .e.g. `Install the slack app` rather than `Install the slack app to your Slack workspace`
2. Don't add header numbers/letters use markdown headers for hierarchy

# Screenshots

1. Use Node Screenshots where possible (Or get as close up as possible)

- Use Chrome -> Inspect -> Right Click Capture Node Screenshot

2. Never include the browser frame
3. The screenshot should have good quality / realistic data - If necessary modify the html before taking a screenshot
4. Infer the screenshot in the sentence before, e.g. In the **Add Health Check modal** you will see

# Code blocks

1. Always include the language and a title
2. Prefer to inline comments into the code
3. Comments should always be on the line above, not on the right hand side unless its really short and reads well e.g. `duration: 5m # since start`
