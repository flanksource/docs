# <Icon name="k8s" /> Kubernetes Resource

The Kubernetes resource check creates kubernetes resources based on the provided manifests & perform checks on them. Some common use case of this
check would be to see if a service is accessible via the ingress as shown in the example below.

```yaml title="ingress_test.yaml"  file=../../../modules/canary-checker/fixtures/k8s/kubernetes_resource_ingress_pass.yaml

```

<HealthCheck

      scheme: 'Duration'
    }
  ]}
/>

### Remote clusters

A single canary-checker instance can connect to any number of remote clusters via custom kubeconfig.
Either the kubeconfig itself or the path to the kubeconfig can be provided.

#### kubeconfig from kubernetes secret

```yaml title="remote-cluster.yaml" file=../../../modules/canary-checker/fixtures/k8s/kubernetes-resource-check-kubeconfig-from-secrets.yaml {12-16} 
```

#### Kubeconfig inline

```yaml title="remote-cluster.yaml" yaml title="remote-cluster.yaml" file=../../../modules/canary-checker/fixtures/k8s/kubernetes-resource-check-inline-kubeconfig.yaml {12-33}
```

#### Kubeconfig from local filesystem

```yaml title="remote-cluster.yaml" file=../../../modules/canary-checker/fixtures/k8s/kubernetes-resource-check-kubeconfig-from-file.yaml {12-13}
```

### Templating

The `resources` and `staticResources` fields can be templated using <CommonLink to="gotemplate">Go Templates</CommonLink>.
This is helpful in creating resources with random names.
Example: you can setup a resource to create a pod with random name on each check run. This way you don't have to wait for the pod to be deleted on every check.

:::info
Templating the **Group**, **Version**, **Kind** & **Namespace** however isn't allowed.

### Examples

<div>

```yaml title="namespace_creation.yaml" file=../../../modules/canary-checker/fixtures/k8s/kubernetes_resource_namespace_pass.yaml

```

:::warning
Since static resources are deleted when the canary is deleted, extra care must be taken when providing their manifests.
When this canary is deleted, the **test** namespace is deleted and consequently all the other resources within it, even those not created by this check.
