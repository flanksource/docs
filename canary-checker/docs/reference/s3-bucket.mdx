### Connecting to AWS

There are 3 options when connecting to AWS:

1. An AWS [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) or [pod identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-configuration.html) (the default if no `connection` or `accessKey` is specified)
2. `connection`, this is the recommended method, connections are reusable and secure

   ```yaml title="aws-connection.yaml"
   apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
   kind: Canary
   metadata:
     name: aws-config-rule
   spec:
     interval: 30
     folder:
       - path: s3://some-bucket/folder
         awsConnection:
           connection: connection://aws/s3
         name: folder-check-min
         minCount: 10
         description: Checks if there are at least 10 files in the folder
   ```

3. `accessKey` and `secretKey` <CommonLink to="authentication">_EnvVar_</CommonLink> with the credentials stored in a secret.

   ```yaml title="aws.yaml"
   apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
   kind: Canary
   metadata:
     name: s3-bucket
   spec:
     interval: 30
     folder:
       - path: s3://some-bucket/folder
         name: folder-check-min
         minCount: 10
         description: Checks if there are at least 10 files in the folder
         awsConnection:
           accessKey:
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: aws-credentials
                 key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
           secretKey:
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: aws-credentials
                 key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
           region: us-east-1
   ```
