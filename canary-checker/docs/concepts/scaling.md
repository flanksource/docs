title: Scaling Canaries up/down
---

Canaries can be scaled up or down just like other kubernetes resources. However, scaling to more than one replica is identical to having just one replica. In other words, scaling a canary can be thought of as a mechanism to turn on/off the canary.

## Example

1. List all the canaries

```bash
kubectl get canaries -o wide
# NAME                REPLICAS   INTERVAL   STATUS   LAST CHECK   UPTIME 1H        LATENCY 1H   LAST TRANSITIONED  ...
# folder-pass         1          300        Failed   34s          0/35 0%          16ms
# folder-pass-empty   1          300        Passed   34s          37/37 (100.0%)   0ms
# s3-bucket-pass      1          30         Failed   3s           0/358 0%         1s
```

2. Scale one of the canaries to 10 replicas

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=10 canaries.canaries.flanksource.com folder-pass
# canary.canaries.flanksource.com/folder-pass scaled
```

```bash
kubectl get canaries folder-pass -o wide
# NAME          REPLICAS   INTERVAL   STATUS   LAST CHECK   UPTIME 1H   LATENCY 1H   LAST TRANSITIONED   MESSAGE   ERROR
# folder-pass   10         300        Failed   3m13s        0/35 0%     16ms
```

3. Scale it down to 0 replicas

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=0 canaries.canaries.flanksource.com folder-pass
# canary.canaries.flanksource.com/folder-pass scaled
```

```bash
kubectl get canaries folder-pass -o wide
# NAME          REPLICAS   INTERVAL   STATUS   LAST CHECK   UPTIME 1H   LATENCY 1H   LAST TRANSITIONED   MESSAGE   ERROR
# folder-pass   0         300        Failed   3m13s        0/35 0%     16ms
```

This effectively stops the canary from running.
