The `transform` can be used to convert one check into multiple checks programmatically.

```yaml title="alertmanager-check.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/canary-checker/fixtures/datasources/alertmanager.yaml
```

In the above example, the check returns multiple alerts from alertmanager. By default, all those alerts are grouped in a single check.

But if we want to display each alert as its own check in the UI, we can use the `transform` function for this. The transform function takes a `Template` as input and the output from the template expected are the checks in JSON format.

For example, if there are 9 different alerts, each alert has its own check that can be managed and interacted with equally.

Transforms can either update checks in-place or return new checks.

## Updating checks in-place

The update a check in place, return a JSON string of `TransformResult` with the updated fields

## Creating new checks

To create a new check, return a JSON string of `[]TransformResult` containing the new checks.
