title: Wait For
---

Kubernetes clusters and similar dynamic systems may experience temporary discrepancies between the actual and intended state of resources. 
For example, a deployment could momentarily appear unhealthy during a scaling operation.
If alerts are configured for `config.unhealthy` events, these transient state fluctuations might lead to an overwhelming number of unnecessary notifications.

To address this issue, you can utilize the waitFor parameter.
This feature allows you to define a delay before sending notifications for specific events.
After an event occurs, the system will recheck its status following the specified wait period. Only if the undesired state persists will a notification be triggered.

:::info
`waitFor` is only applicable on health related events
:::

This approach helps reduce unnecessary notifications caused by transient state changes, ensuring you're alerted only to persistent issues.
