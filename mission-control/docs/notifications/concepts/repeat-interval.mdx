title: Repeat Interval
---

The repeat interval determines the duration between subsequent notifications after an initial successful delivery.

```yaml title="deployment-failed.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: config-updates
  namespace: default
spec:
  events:
    - config.healthy
    - config.unhealthy
    - config.warning
    - config.unknown
  filter: config.type == "Kubernetes::Deployment"
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
  repeatInterval: 2h
```

The above notification sends at max 1 email notification in a moving 2 hour window.

## Repeat Group

By default, the repeat interval applies to any notification sent for the given notification. 

In the example above, if a notification is sent for a `config.healthy` event and then a new notification is to be sent
for a `config.unhealthy` event, then the notification is dropped due to the repeat interval.

With grouping, you can apply the repeat interval per source event & per resource ID.

- `source_event`
- `resource_id`

```yaml title="deployment-updates.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: config-updates
  namespace: default
spec:
  events:
    - config.healthy
    - config.unhealthy
    - config.warning
    - config.unknown
  filter: config.type == "Kubernetes::Deployment"
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
  repeatInterval: 2h
  // highlight-start
  repeatGroup:
    - source_event
  // highlight-end
```

With this change, you'll now receive at max 4 notifications for each source event.
