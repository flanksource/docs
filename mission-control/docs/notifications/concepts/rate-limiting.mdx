title: Rate Limiting
---

To prevent overwhelming users with excessive notifications, Mission Control implements a rate limiting mechanism.

We use a sliding window rate limiter that restricts the total number of notifications sent within a specified time period.

:::info
The rate limit is applied individually to each notification.
:::

:::caution Rate Limited Notifications
When a notification exceeds the rate limit, it is dropped and not delivered to the user.

## Default Configuration

The following table outlines the default rate limiting parameters:

| Property                         | Value    |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| Maximum number of notifications allowed per window  | 50       |
| Time period for the sliding window                  | 4 hours  | 

## Customizing Rate Limiting Parameters

You can override the default settings by adjusting the following properties:

- `notifications.max.count`: Sets the maximum number of notifications allowed within the window
- `notifications.max.window`: Defines the duration of the sliding window (in hours)

### Example Configuration

To allow a maximum of 100 notifications in a 6 hour window:

```
notifications.max.count=100
notifications.max.window=6h
```
