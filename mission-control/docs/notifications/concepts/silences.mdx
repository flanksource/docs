title: Silences
---

Silences prevent notifications from being sent. 
Silences are attached to a particular resource (`catalog`, `health check`, or `component`) and are active for a specified duration.

:::note
Notifications that aren't sent due to silence are still visible in the notification history for auditing purposes.

## Use cases

- Planned maintenance or deployments. Eg: You can silence a namespace or a helm release and automatically silence notifications from all of their children.
- Non-critical resources: Notifications from resources that routinely trigger alerts but are expected and harmless can be silenced.
- Known issues: If there's a known issue that can't be immediately resolved (e.g., due to dependencies or resource constraints), you might silence related alerts until a fix can be implemented.

## Add Silence

Silences can be added from the notification page. Alternatively, if you're using the default slack notification templates, you get a silence button
on each notification.

## Recursive mode

When a silence is recursively applied, it applies to all of its children. 
So silencing a namespace would silence all deployments, statefulsets, pods, etc in that namespace.
