# Generic
The Generic service can be used for any target that is not explicitly supported by Mission Control, as long as it
supports receiving the message via a POST request.
Usually, this requires customization on the receiving end to interpret the payload that it receives, and might
not be a viable approach.

### URL Fields

<Fields rows={[
    {
        "field": "host",
        "scheme": "string"
    },
    {
        "field": "port",
        "scheme": "int"
    },
    {
        "field": "path",
        "scheme": "string"
    },
  {
    "field": "contentType",
    "description": "The value of the Content-Type header",
    "scheme": "string",
    "default": "application/json"
  },
  {
    "field": "disableTLS",
    "scheme": "bool",
    "default": "false"
  },
  {
    "field": "messageKey",
    "description": "The key that will be used for the message value",
    "scheme": "string",
    "default": "message"
  },
  {
    "field": "requestMethod",
    "scheme": "string",
    "default": "POST"
  },
  {
    "field": "template",
    "description": "The template used for creating the request payload",
    "scheme": "string"
  },
  {
    "field": "title",
    "scheme": "string"
  },
  {
    "field": "titleKey",
    "description": "The key that will be used for the title value",
    "scheme": "string",
    "default": "title"
  }
]}/>



## Custom headers
You can add additional HTTP headers to your request by adding query variables prefixed with `@` (`@key=value`).

Using
```url
generic://example.com?@acceptLanguage=tlh-Piqd
```
would result in the additional header being added:

```http
Accept-Language: tlh-Piqd
```

## JSON template
By using the built in `JSON` template (`template=json`) you can create a generic JSON payload. The keys used for `title` and `message` can be overriden
by supplying the params/query values `titleKey` and `messageKey`.

!!! example
    ```json
    {
        "title": "Oh no!",
        "message": "The thing happened and now there is stuff all over the area!"
    }
    ```

### Custom data fields
When using the JSON template, you can add additional key/value pairs to the JSON object by adding query variables prefixed with `$` (`$key=value`).


Using `generic://example.com?$projection=retroazimuthal` would yield:

```json
{
    "title": "Amazing opportunities!",
    "message": "New map book available for purchase.",
    "projection": "retroazimuthal"
}
```

## Shortcut URL
You can just add `generic+` as a prefix to your target URL to use it with the generic service, so
```url
https://example.com/api/v1/postStuff
```
would become
```url
generic+https://example.com/api/v1/postStuff
```

:::note
    Any query variables added to the URL will be escaped so that they can be forwarded to the remote server. That means that you cannot use `?template=json` with the  `generic+https://`, just use `generic://` instead!
