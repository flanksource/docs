title: Security
---

At Flanksource, security isn't just a feature; it's the foundation of the design that went into the Mission Control platform. We've meticulously designed every aspect of our internal developer platform to meet the stringent requirements of security teams.

## Secure SDLC

Flanksource follows a secure SDLC

1. Code scanning using Github [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)
2. Merge blocking unit and integration tests using Github Actions
3. Branch protection to prevent history rewrite
4. Automatic dependency scanning and updates with Github [Dependabot](https://github.com/features/security/software-supply-chain)
5. Project CI/CD compliance scanning using [OpenSSF Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/)
6. Automated build and publishing of artifacts
7. CI Supply Chain Runtime Scanner using [Step Harden Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner)

## Secret Management

All flanksource projects are built with secure secret management in mind, where possible secrets are automatically generated at install time and saved to Kubernetes Secrets, Pre-existing secrets are read from environment variables/files supplied by end users using Kubernetes Secrets or Helm Values

Role based IAM identity is possible and preferred for Kubernetes, AWS, GKE and Azure.

## Source Open

All the code for Mission Control self-hosted is publicly available and free to use for non-prod purposes, Enabling any security researcher to review the source code and perform white-box testing.

The security scan results for all projects are available in the links below.
