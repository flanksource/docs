# NotificationSilence

The `NotificationSilence` CRD allows you to define periods when specific notifications should be silenced to prevent alert fatigue and manage maintenance windows.

## Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: NotificationSilence
metadata:
  name: example-silence
spec:
  # Time period for the silence
  start: "2023-06-01T10:00:00Z"
  end: "2023-06-01T14:00:00Z"
  
  # Selector for events to silence
  selector:
    components:
      - database-cluster
      - api-service
    labels:
      environment: production
      
  # Reason for the silence
  reason: "Scheduled database maintenance"
```
