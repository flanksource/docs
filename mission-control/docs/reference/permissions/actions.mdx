# Permission Actions Reference

## Core Actions

These are the fundamental CRUD operations that can be applied to any resource in Mission Control.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `*` | Grants full access to all operations on the specified resource. Use with caution as this provides unrestricted access. |
| `create,read,update,delete` | Explicit specification of all CRUD operations. Functionally equivalent to `*` but more explicit. |
| `create` | Allows creating new instances of a resource |
| `read` | Allows viewing and listing resources |
| `update` | Allows modifying existing resources |
| `delete` | Allows removing resources |

## Playbook-Specific Actions

These actions are specific to playbook resources and provide fine-grained control over playbook execution and approval workflows.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `playbook:run` | Allows execution of playbooks |
| `playbook:approve` | Allows approving playbook execution requests |
