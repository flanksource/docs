Playbooks automate common workflows and processes by defining reusable templates of actions that can be triggered on-demand by users, when specific events happen or through webhooks.

Some key benefits include:

* **Accelerated GitOps Adoption** - Use  _"ClickOps"_ to make changes to resources but have them being applied as Git pull requests in the background, enabling non-technical teams to leverage GitOps workflows.
* **Consistency** - Provide easy to discover and reusable templates for common tasks, preventing the complexity of doing the same thing multiple ways.
* **Self-Service** - Enable developers/operators to provision and manage their own resources without involving a central DevOps/Platform team.
* **Compliance** - Improve compliance and security by limiting the need for elevated privileges.
* **Cost Efficiency** - Optimize costs with on-demand environments that spin down after a fixed duration.
* **Portability** - A consistent interface for performing operations irrespective of the underlying infrastructure and/or environment

## Use cases


### Provisioning



### Day 2 Operations

Day 2 operations can be added onto existing resources using `configs`, `components` or health `checks` using [resource selectors](/reference/resource-selector).

For example Restarting a Kubernetes Deployment is only applicable to config items of type: `Kubernetes::Deployment`

```yaml title="scale-deployment.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  configs:
    - types:
        - Kubernetes::Deployment
   #....
```

Before running a playbook, users can provide input using [`parameters`](/reference/playbooks/parameters)
```yaml title="parameters.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  # user input
  parameters:
    - name: replicas
  # ...

```

### Just In Time Access

### AIOps



```


## Parameters

Playbooks have 2 types of parameters:




```yaml title="restrict-to-deployment.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  # components: ...
  # checks: ...
  //highlight-next-line
  configs:
    - types:
        - Kubernetes::Deployment
```

## Self-Service




## Events

## Webhooks


## Actions

Playbooks execute a sequence of actions (steps), these actions can update git repositories, invoke pipelines or run command line tools like `kubectl` and `aws`.

### Templating

The actions values can be templated using [Go Templates](/reference/scripting/gotemplate)

```yaml title="restart-deployment.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  configs:
    - types:
        - Kubernetes::Deployment
  actions:
    - name: 'Restart kubernetes deployment'
      exec:
        //highlight-next-line
        script: kubectl rollout restart deployment {{.config.name}} -n {{.config.tags.namespace}}
```

The parameters to the playbooks are available in the [Context](reference/playbooks/context)

### Runners

## Approvals

Playbooks can require approval before execution by configuring an `approval` block:

```yaml title="approve-kubernetes-scaling.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  #...
  approval:
    type: any
    approvers:
      people:
        - admin@local
      teams:
        - DevOps
```

| Field       | Description                    | Scheme       | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| `type`      | How many approvals required. Defaults to `all`    | `any` or `all`     | `false`  |
| `approvers.[]people` | Login or id of a person| `People` | `false`  |
| `approvers.[]teams` | Name or id of a team | `Team` | `false`  |
