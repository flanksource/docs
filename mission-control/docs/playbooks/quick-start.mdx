# Quick Start

In this walkthrough, we'll create and run a playbook that scales a Kubernetes deployment.
The only prerequisites are

- you have a config item for a Kubernetes Deployment
- you have kubectl configured.

<Step step={1} name="Create a playbook">

```yaml title="restart-deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Playbook
metadata:
  name: restart-deployment
spec:
  description: Restart deployment
  configs:
    - types:
        - Kubernetes::Deployment
  actions:
    - name: 'Restart kubernetes deployment'
      exec:
        script: kubectl rollout restart deployment {{.config.name}} -n {{.config.tags.namespace}}
```


This playbook is designed to run on a Kubernetes Deployment (with a config type of `Kubernetes::Deployment`).

Save the above YAML to a file called `scale-deployment.yaml`. Then, to store the playbook, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f scale-deployment.yaml
```

</Step>
<Step step={2} name="Run a playbook">

To run the playbook, we need its id. In addition to that please get the id for the deployment config item that you want to scale.

```bash
curl -sL -X POST -u 'admin@local:admin' \
  --json '{
    "id": "<playbook_id>",
    "config_id": "<config_id>",
    "params": {
      "replicas": "1"
    }
  }' \
  localhost:8080/playbook/run
```

The above command scales the deployment of the given config item to just 1 replica. Since the playbook didn't have any approvers defined, the run starts immediately.

</Step>
<Step step={3} name="See the Results">

At this stage, the run should have terminated successfully. We can check the status of the run by running:

```bash
curl -sL -X GET -u 'admin@local:admin' \
  localhost:8080/playbook/run/<run_id>
```

The run id is returned by the API call in the previous step.
</Step>
