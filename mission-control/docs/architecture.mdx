![](/img/architecture.svg)

Mission Control has a micro-service architecture with a shared data source with multiple deployment models.

import EnvVarTypes from './partials/_envVarTypes.mdx'



1. CLI
2. Kubernetes (Helm Chart)
3. SaaS

## Communication Model

Communication between services happen in 3 ways:

1. **Database** - A shared database with interface library enables services to query the data owned by other services by directly hitting the database using an interface provided by a shared library
2. **Messaging** - A postgres based message bus is used, database triggers insert events into queues which are then consumed by various services
3. **HTTP/REST** - This model is primarily used when the service need to interact with services outside the DB (e.g. the APM hub needs to connect to log stores to retrieve logs)

## Postgres

Postgres is the only data store used by Mission Control and relies heavily on JSON and queuing support in Postgres. This limits the dependencies and complexity especially when self-hosting.

All services use a shared database and model via the [duty](https://github.com/flanksource/duty) project, this provides the following benefits:


* Limit RPC calls improving latency and performance
* Services can run with slightly different versions of the library, limiting the need for coordinated migrations
* Library updates happen automatically using dependabot
