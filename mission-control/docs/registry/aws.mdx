The AWS bundle installs a catalog [scraper](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws) that:

- Scrapes AWS Resources and detects changes in the resource definition
- Ingests changes from CloudTrail
- Ingests cost data from AWS Cost & Usage Reporting
- Links AWS EKS resources to the corresponding Kubernetes resources


:::info Prerequisites
- IAM Role for scraping AWS API's
- Mission Control configured to use Pod Identity/IRSA or an AWS access key
:::

## Setup

```sh
helm repo add flanksource https://flanksource.github.io/charts
helm repo update

```
