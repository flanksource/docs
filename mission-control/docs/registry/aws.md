The AWS helm chart installs a [catalog scraper](/config-db/scrapers/aws)

## Setup

```sh
helm repo add flanksource https://flanksource.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install mission-control-aws flanksource/mission-control-aws
```

After running `helm install` you should get a success message:

```sh

LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb 14 19:00:32 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:

When you go to the catalog now, you can now see all the AWS Resources

## Prerequisites

1. Connection to AWS must be authenticated via IAM Roles for Service Accounts or AWS Access and Secret Key. [Click Here to see how to configure AWS](/installation/aws-eks)

2. The role should have permissions to fetch the AWS Resources

3. Cost Reporting should also be setup if you want to associate costs to each resource. [Check the guide here](/installation/aws-eks#cost-reporting)
