When using the Mission Control SaaS the agent based approach is recommended for ingesting data, The agent is headless installation of mission-control that caches data locally in a postgres database and replicates it to the SaaS.

The agent based approach has the following benefits:

- **Least privilege**, as the agent runs within your infrastructure there is no network access or credentials required to be configured on the SaaS.
- **CRD Based Configuration** of [health checks](/docs/guide/canary-checker/) and [scrape configs](/docs/guide/config-db) co-located with your IaC/App without the need to push any config to the SaaS.
- **Local Playbook Execution** on agents, reusing existing secrets or IAM roles.


See [Installation](/docs/installation) for other deployment models including [Self Hosted](/docs/installation/self-hosted/getting-started)
