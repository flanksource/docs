When using the Mission Control SaaS the agent based approach is recommended for ingesting data, The agent is headless installation of mission-control that caches data locally in a postgres database and replicates it to the SaaS.

The agent based approach has the following benefits:

1. **Least privilege**, as the agent runs within your infrastructure there is no network access or credentials required to be configured on the SaaS.
2. **CRD Based Configuration** of [health checks](/canary-checker/) and [scrape configs](/config-db) co-located with your IaC/App without the need to push any config to the SaaS.
3. **Local Playbook Execution** on agents, reusing existing secrets or IAM roles.
