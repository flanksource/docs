Mission Control is an internal developer platform built for operations. Built with a "self-hosted first" approach, Mission Control gives you complete control over your deployment environment while offering enterprise-grade features.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

When you self-host Mission Control, you maintain full ownership of your infrastructure and data while enjoying the same robust feature set available in the SaaS offering. In fact, some advanced features are exclusively available in the self-hosted version.

### Why Self-Host Mission Control?

**Key Benefits**
- **Infrastructure Flexibility**: Deploy on your preferred infrastructure - whether on-premise, AWS, GCP, Azure, or any other Kubernetes environment
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep all your monitoring and operational data within your own environment
- **Security Control**: Leverage your existing security practices and compliance frameworks
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource allocation and scaling based on your specific needs
- **Customization**: Tailor the platform to integrate with your specific infrastructure components

**Implementation Considerations**
- Configuration and management of authentication (SSO) is required
- Database management responsibilities remain with your team
- Updates and maintenance follow standard Kubernetes patterns

This guide walks you through the complete setup process for your self-hosted Mission Control environment.


:::info Prerequisites
To install and run Mission Control you need the following:

- Kubernetes 1.26+ with an Ingress Controller
- [cert-manager.io](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) or an existing TLS secret for ingress
- 1 - 2 CPU's and 6-8GB of Memory (2-4GB if using an external DB)
- Persistent Volumes with 20GB+ of storage or an external postgres database
- (Optional) [prometheus operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/)
- (Optional) SMTP Server (For sending notifications and invites)
:::


1. Choose a routable `DOMAIN` for Mission Control
    <p/>
    > See [Ingress](/reference/helm/mission-control#ingress) for more options on configuring the ingress including generating certs with cert-manager
    > <p>See [Local Testing](../local-testing) for testing using a kind or minikube without a routable domain</p>

1. Install Mission Control
    <p/>
    :::tip
    If you are installing on EKS and plan to scrape AWS resources use the method described in [EKS](./eks) instead
    :::

    <Helm values={{
      "global.ui.host": "DOMAIN"
    }} />
    <p/>

2. Login @ https://DOMAIN/
