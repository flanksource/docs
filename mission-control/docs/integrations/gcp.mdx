<CapabilityHeading type="scraper" />

Discover and catalog GCP resources with full change history and relationships.

**Use cases:**
- Discover and catalog Compute Engine VMs, Cloud SQL instances, GKE clusters, and other GCP resources
- Track configuration changes across projects and folders
- Correlate GCP resources with GKE workloads and Terraform state
- Build relationships between GCP services and their dependencies
- Support organization-wide visibility with folder-based access

---

<CapabilityHeading type="healthcheck" />

Monitor GCP services and endpoints with health checks.

**Use cases:**
- Monitor Cloud Storage bucket availability and object health
- Check Cloud SQL database connectivity and status
- Verify GKE cluster health and node status

## Getting Started

:::info Prerequisites
To enable the GCP integration you need:

- Mission Control [installed](/docs/installation/)
- [kubectl](/docs/installation/saas/kubectl) access to the Mission Control instance
- GCP service account credentials or GKE Workload Identity configured for the `config-db` service.
:::

1. Install the [mission-control-gcp](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/flanksource/mission-control-gcp) chart

   <Helm chart="mission-control-gcp"
   createRepo={false}
   schema={Schema}
   createNamespace={false}
   values={{
    "project": "<your-project-name>",
   }}/>


When you go to the catalog now, you can now see all the GCP Resources
