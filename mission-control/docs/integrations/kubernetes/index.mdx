Mission Control provides deep integration with Kubernetes clusters. Use it to:

- Discover and catalog Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and all Kubernetes resources
- Monitor pod health, resource usage, and cluster events
- Track configuration changes with full diff history
- Correlate workloads with Helm releases, GitOps deployments, and cloud infrastructure
- Run playbooks to restart pods, scale deployments, or execute kubectl commands
- Send notifications to Slack, Teams, or PagerDuty when resources change state
