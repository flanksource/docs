Mission Control integrates with Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) to provide visibility into your identity infrastructure. Use it to:

- Discover users, groups, and their memberships across your tenant
- Track app registrations and enterprise applications
- Monitor service principal configurations and permissions
- Audit app role assignments and authentication methods
- Correlate identity resources with Azure subscriptions and Kubernetes RBAC

## Config Scrapers

Discover and track Azure AD resources in the catalog.

### What You Can Scrape

- **Users**: All user accounts with their profile information
- **Groups**: Security and Microsoft 365 groups with membership
- **App Registrations**: Applications registered in your tenant
- **Enterprise Applications**: Service principals and their configurations
- **App Role Assignments**: Who has access to which applications

### Example

```yaml title="azure-ad-scraper.yaml"
apiVersion: configs.flanksource.com/v1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: azure-ad
spec:
  schedule: "@every 1h"
  azure:
    - tenantID: your-tenant-id
      clientID:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: azure-credentials
            key: client-id
      clientSecret:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: azure-credentials
            key: client-secret
      activeDirectory:
        users: true
        groups: true
        appRegistrations: true
        enterpriseApplications: true
```

## Prerequisites

To scrape Azure AD resources, your service principal needs the following Microsoft Graph API permissions:

- `User.Read.All` - Read user profiles
- `Group.Read.All` - Read groups and memberships
- `Application.Read.All` - Read app registrations
- `Directory.Read.All` - Read directory data
