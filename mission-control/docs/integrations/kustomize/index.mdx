Mission Control integrates with Kustomize to simplify configuration management through GitOps-native playbooks.

## Quick Start

<Prereqs />

Kustomize integration works with Flux GitOps. Ensure Flux is configured to manage your Kustomizations before using these playbooks.

<CapabilityHeading type="playbook" />

**Use cases:**
- Create Deployments, HelmReleases, and Namespaces through guided playbooks
- Modify existing resources via Kustomize patches without editing YAML manually
- Scale replicas or update resource limits across environments
- Commit changes back to Git repositories through Flux GitOps workflows
- Generate pull requests for review before applying changes

Automate Kustomize operations through GitOps-native playbooks that create pull requests for all changes:

### Resource Creation

Create new resources within Flux-managed Kustomizations:

| Playbook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Create Deployment** | Add a new Deployment with configurable image, CPU, and memory settings |
| **Create HelmRelease** | Add a HelmRelease to a Kustomization for Helm chart management |
| **Create Kustomization** | Create a new Flux Kustomization pointing to a path in your repository |
| **Create Namespace** | Add a namespace managed by an existing Kustomization |

### Resource Modification

Modify existing resources through Kustomize patches:

| Playbook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Edit Kustomization** | Modify Kustomization settings like interval, path, or source reference |
| **Scale Resources** | Adjust replica counts for Deployments via Kustomize patches |
| **Update Resources** | Modify CPU and memory requests/limits |

### Example: Create Deployment

This playbook creates a Deployment manifest and updates the Kustomization to include it, then opens a pull request for review:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/modules/generated/playbooks/kustomize-create-deployment.yaml title='kustomize-create-deployment.yaml'
```

The playbook:
1. Accepts parameters for name, image, and resource limits
2. Generates a Deployment manifest in the repository
3. Patches the `kustomization.yaml` to include the new resource
4. Creates a pull request with the changes
