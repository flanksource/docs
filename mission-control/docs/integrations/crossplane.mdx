# Crossplane Integration

Mission Control integrates deeply with Crossplane to provide visibility and relationships across your cloud infrastructure resources managed through Crossplane.

## How It Works

Mission Control's Kubernetes scraper (`kubernetes.go`) automatically detects and handles Crossplane resources by:

1. Identifying Crossplane resources through their API group - any resource with an apiVersion containing `.upbound.io` or `.crossplane.io` is treated as a Crossplane resource.

2. Categorizing them with a special "Crossplane::" type prefix instead of the standard "Kubernetes::" prefix to distinguish them from regular Kubernetes resources.

3. Building relationships between:
   - Crossplane managed resources and their providers
   - Crossplane composite resources (XRs) and their composed resources
   - Crossplane resources and their underlying cloud infrastructure

## Resource Relationships

The scraper automatically establishes relationships between:

- Crossplane Providers and their managed resources
- Composite Resources (XRs) and their composed resources
- Crossplane managed resources and their cloud provider equivalents (e.g. AWS RDS instances)

The relationships are created through:

1. Owner references on managed resources pointing to their providers
2. Cross-references between XRs and composed resources
3. Cloud provider specific external IDs linking to actual cloud resources

## Scraping and Monitoring

The scraper:

- Watches for changes to Crossplane resources through the Kubernetes event stream
- Tracks health and status of Crossplane resources
- Maps relationships between components
- Provides visibility into the full stack - from Crossplane CRDs down to cloud resources

This enables Mission Control to provide a complete view of your Crossplane-managed infrastructure with proper relationship mapping and real-time updates.
