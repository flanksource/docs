Mission Control integrates with Microsoft Teams to send notifications to channels.

---

<CapabilityHeading type="notifications" />

**Use cases:**
- Send alerts to Teams channels when health checks fail or configs change
- Format notifications with rich MessageCard layouts
- Route notifications to different channels based on severity or team
- Customize message titles and theme colors
- Keep teams informed of incidents and infrastructure changes

Send notifications to Microsoft Teams channels using incoming webhooks.
