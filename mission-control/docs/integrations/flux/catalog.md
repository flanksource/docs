Mission Control provides built-in support for relating Flux resources to each other, determining their health status, and building a dependency graph. This allows you to:

- Visualize relationships between Flux resources like `Kustomizations`, `HelmReleases`, `GitRepositories` etc.
- Track the health and status of related Flux resources
- Understand dependencies between resources to troubleshoot issues
- Build a graph showing how Flux resources connect and depend on each other
- Monitor the overall health of your Flux-based GitOps workflows
