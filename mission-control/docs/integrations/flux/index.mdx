Mission Control integrates with Flux to provide visibility into your GitOps workflows and automate reconciliation management.

---

<CapabilityHeading type="scraper" />

Discover and track Flux resources with their reconciliation status and dependencies.

**Use cases:**
- Discover GitRepositories, Kustomizations, and HelmReleases with their reconciliation status
- Visualize the full dependency tree to identify which component is blocking reconciliation
- Correlate reconciliation failures with source Git repository issues or cluster problems
- Track changes to Flux resources and their configuration over time

---

<CapabilityHeading type="playbook" />

Automate Flux operations and GitOps workflows with playbooks.

**Use cases:**
- Suspend and resume reconciliation directly from the UI
- Trigger manual reconciliation for immediate deployment
- Request temporary namespace access for debugging
- Roll back to previous Git revisions when deployments fail
