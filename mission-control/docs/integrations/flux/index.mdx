Mission Control integrates with Flux to provide visibility into your GitOps workflows. Use it to:

- Discover GitRepositories, Kustomizations, and HelmReleases with their reconciliation status
- Visualize the full dependency tree to identify which component is blocking reconciliation
- Suspend and resume reconciliation directly from the UI
- Trigger manual reconciliation or request temporary namespace access for debugging
- Correlate reconciliation failures with source Git repository issues or cluster problems
