# Terraform

</CapabilityBadges>

Mission Control integrates with Terraform to provide visibility into your infrastructure-as-code. Use it to:

- Discover resources managed by Terraform across your state files
- Build relationships between Terraform modules and the AWS resources they create
- Track state file changes and correlate with infrastructure drift
- Map ARN-based connections between EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, and other AWS services
- Understand infrastructure dependencies by linking Terraform configurations to cloud resources

## How It Works

The Terraform scraper performs the following key functions:

1. **State File Processing**:
   - Loads Terraform state files from specified locations
   - Parses the JSON state data to extract resource information
   - Maintains the state file lineage as a unique identifier

2. **Resource Relationship Mapping**:
   - Identifies managed AWS resources in the Terraform state
   - Extracts ARN (Amazon Resource Name) information from resource attributes
   - Creates relationships between Terraform configurations and AWS resources using ARNs

3. **Configuration Tracking**:
   - Creates unique configurations for each Terraform state
   - Masks sensitive attributes in the state data
   - Maintains aliases and identifiers for tracking purposes

## Example Configuration

```yaml
spec:
  terraform:
    - name: "{{.path}}"  # Uses the state file path as the configuration name
      state:
        path: "/path/to/terraform/states"  # Directory containing terraform state files
```

The scraper currently supports AWS resources and can extract relationships based on various ARN attributes including:
- Standard ARN
- Policy ARN
- Function ARN
- Role ARN
- KMS Key ARN
- Bucket ARN
- Topic ARN
- Queue ARN
- Lambda ARN
- Cluster ARN
- Instance ARN
- Execution ARN
- Stream ARN

## Generated Relationships

For each AWS resource found in the Terraform state, the scraper creates a relationship between:
- The Terraform module configuration (identified by its lineage)
- The corresponding AWS resource (identified by its ARN)

These relationships help in:
- Understanding resource dependencies
- Tracking infrastructure changes
- Mapping infrastructure relationships across your AWS environment
