Mission Control provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with your infrastructure.

**Use cases:**
- Query the config catalog and explore infrastructure relationships
- List and inspect health checks across your environment
- Execute playbooks to remediate issues or perform operations
- Manage connections, artifacts, and notifications
- Enable AI-assisted troubleshooting and incident response

## MCP Server

Mission Control exposes an MCP server endpoint that AI assistants can connect to for infrastructure interactions.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Catalog** | Query config items, search by type, and explore relationships |
| **Health Checks** | List canary health checks, view status and history |
| **Playbooks** | List available playbooks and trigger executions |
| **Connections** | Browse configured connections to external systems |
| **Artifacts** | List and retrieve artifacts from playbook runs |
| **Notifications** | View notification configurations |
| **Jobs** | Monitor scheduled jobs and their status |

### Connecting Claude Desktop

Add Mission Control to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json title="claude_desktop_config.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mission-control": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://your-mission-control.example.com/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${MISSION_CONTROL_TOKEN}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

The MCP server requires authentication with the `mcp:run` permission. Create an API token with appropriate RBAC permissions:

```bash
kubectl create token mission-control-mcp --duration=8760h
```

### Example Interactions

Once connected, you can ask Claude questions like:

- "What health checks are failing right now?"
- "Show me all Kubernetes deployments in the production namespace"
- "Run the restart-pod playbook for the api-server deployment"
- "What config changes happened in the last hour?"

## Architecture

```

The MCP server translates natural language requests from AI assistants into Mission Control API calls, enabling conversational infrastructure management.
