# ArgoCD

Mission Control integrates with ArgoCD to provide monitoring and relationship tracking of ArgoCD Applications and their associated resources.

## Resource Scraping & Relationships

The integration automatically scrapes ArgoCD Applications (Custom Resources with apiVersion starting with `argoproj.io`) and establishes parent-child relationships between the Application and its deployed resources. This is done by:

1. Examining the `status.resources` field of ArgoCD Applications
2. Creating links between the Application and each resource referenced in the status
3. Tracking resources across all supported Kubernetes types like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps etc.

For example, if an ArgoCD Application deploys a Deployment and Service, Mission Control will automatically:
- Detect the Application as the parent resource
- Link it to the child Deployment and Service resources
- Allow you to navigate and view the full resource hierarchy

## Health Status

ArgoCD's built-in health checks are used to determine the overall health status of Applications and their resources. The status is gathered from ArgoCD's native health assessment and surfaced in Mission Control's UI.


## Topology

The Argo topology can be used to monitor and manage both an Argo instance and the Argo applications created
