Mission Control integrates with ArgoCD to provide visibility into your GitOps deployments.

## Quick Start

<Prereqs />

<Helm chart="mission-control-argocd" schema={Schema} />

<CapabilityHeading type="scraper" />

**Use cases:**
- Discover Applications and ApplicationSets with their sync status and health state
- Track the full resource hierarchy from Applications to Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps
- Correlate failed syncs with recent Git commits or cluster configuration changes
- Monitor sync status changes over time with full history
- Navigate relationships between Applications and the Kubernetes resources they deploy

The ArgoCD integration automatically discovers and tracks config items in the unified catalog:

- **Applications**: Track sync status, health state, and target revisions for each Application
- **ApplicationSets**: Monitor template-generated applications and their parameters
- **Deployed Resources**: Correlate Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and other resources with their parent Applications

## Resource Relationships

The integration examines the `status.resources` field of ArgoCD Applications and establishes parent-child relationships between the Application and its deployed resources:

1. Detects the Application as the parent config item
2. Links it to child Deployments, Services, and other resources referenced in the status
3. Tracks resources across all supported Kubernetes types

For example, if an ArgoCD Application deploys a Deployment and Service, Mission Control automatically links them in the catalog, allowing navigation through the full resource hierarchy.

## Health Status

ArgoCD's built-in health checks determine the overall health status of Applications and their resources. The status is gathered from ArgoCD's native health assessment and displayed alongside other health indicators in the catalog.
