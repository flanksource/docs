Mission Control integrates with AWS to provide visibility into your cloud infrastructure. Use it to:

- Discover and catalog EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, and other AWS resources
- Monitor S3 bucket availability, CloudWatch metrics, and service health
- Track configuration changes across accounts and regions
- Correlate AWS resources with Kubernetes workloads and Terraform state
- Trigger automated remediation playbooks when health checks fail
- Send alerts to SNS topics or integrate with AWS incident workflows
