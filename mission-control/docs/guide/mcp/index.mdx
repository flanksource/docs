# MCP

Mission Control supports MCP for those who want to link it with their LLM Clients.

## Setup

The MCP HTTP Server runs at the `/mcp` endpoint.

For SaaS users: `https://mc.<org-id>.workload-prod-eu-02.flanksource.com/mcp`

For self hosted users: `https://your.domain.com/api/mcp`

For detailed setup instructions for popular MCP clients, see [Client Setup](./client-setup.mdx).

## Permissions

To access the mcp server, `Authorization` header can be used with a token. The token must have `mcp.*` permission.
