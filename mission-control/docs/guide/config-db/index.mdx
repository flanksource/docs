## Catalog

The Mission Control Catalog is a centralized repository that automatically discovers, transforms and tracks infrastructure, applications and configuration across many environments.



<img src="/img/config-db.svg" width="900px" className='pb-10'></img>



Some key benefits include:

* **Automatic Discovery** - Automatically discovers resources by scraping external systems like Kubernetes, AWS, Git, SQL, etc
* **Changes** - Track changes to resources over time through diff or event based change detection, improving MTTR drastically.
* **Insights** - Aggregate security, cost, performance and reliability insights from AWS Trusted Advisor, Config Rules, Azure Monitor, Trivy etc.
* **Dependency Mapping** - Automatically map dependencies between resources to understand impact of changes.
* **Single Pane of Glass** - Browse, search and take action on resources without the need to switch between multiple consoles.

:::info
Under the hood the catalog is powered by [github.com/flanksource/config-db](https://github.com/flanksource/config-db).
:::

The catalog is comprised of:

* **Config Items** are individual resources e.g. `Pod`, `EBS`, `IAM Role`, `postgres.conf` scraped from external sources like [AWS](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws), [Kubernetes](/guide/config-db/scrapers/kubernetes), [Azure](/guide/config-db/scrapers/azure), [Azure DevOps](/guide/config-db/scrapers/azure-devops), [GitHub](/guide/config-db/scrapers/github)
* **Changes** recorded against config items either through automatic change detection (diffs) or from sources like [CloudTrail](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws#cloudtrail) or [Kubernetes Events](/guide/config-db/scrapers/kubernetes#events)
* **Insights** recorded against config items from external sources like [Trusted Advisor](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws#trusted-advisor) or [Trivy](/guide/config-db/scrapers/trivy)
* **Relationships** between configuration items


## Scraping

Config items, insights and change are ingested using scrapers which are jobs that run periodically, scrapers come in 2 types:

<Step step={1} name="Native" style="list">


Native scrapers ingest config items from common sources like [AWS](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws), [Kubernetes](/guide/config-db/scrapers/kubernetes), [Azure](/guide/config-db/scrapers/azure) and automatically add metadata and relationships
</Step>

<Step step={2} name="Custom" style="list">

Custom scrapers ingest raw data from [File](/guide/config-db/scrapers/file) and [SQL](/guide/config-db/scrapers/sql) queries the results of which need to mapped to metadata and relationships manually.

</Step>


A configuration summary is shown below:
