Catalog items can have tags attached to them.

For [AWS](/guide/config-db/scrapers/aws), these can be `zone-id`, `region` and `account`.
[Kubernetes](/guide/config-db/scrapers/kubernetes) resources have `cluster` and `namespace` tags associated with them.

The tags for any catalog item are visible on it's page in the sidebar.

## Usage

### Filters

Tags help filter catalog items in UI (inclusion and exclusion)

### Topology (Group By)

Topologies can be [grouped by](/reference/topology/crd#group-by) tags and resource selectors. This is useful when similar resources are present having different tags.

Example: Flux topology can be grouped by cluster tag, AWS Topology can be grouped by the account tag

### RBAC

[RBAC](/reference/rbac) rules can use tags to fine-grain access to limited resources.
