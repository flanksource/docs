Catalog items can have tags attached to them.

For AWS, these can be `zone-id`, `region` and `account`.
Kubernetes resources have `cluster` and `namespace` tags associated with them.

The tags for any catalog item are visible on it's page in the sidebar.

## Usage

Once items are tagged, they can be used for:

### Filters

### Topology (Group By)

Topologies can be be [grouped by](https://flanksource.com/docs/reference/topology/crd#group-by) tags and resource selectors. This is useful when similar resources are present having different tags.

Example: Flux topology can be grouped by cluster tag, AWS Topology can be grouped by the account tag

### RBAC

[RBAC](Link) rules can use tags to fine-grain access to limited resources
