title: Push
---

We can push the topologies we create to any mission control host. We just have to define a [HTTPConnection](/reference/connections/http)

:::info
This is different from using an agent as using this can push topologies anywhere even if those instances do not have an agent setup
:::

```yaml title="topology.yaml"
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Topology
metadata:
  name: Website
spec:
  push:
    url: https://my-mission-control.company.com
    username:
      value: admin
    password:
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: credentials
          key: password
        
  components:

```
