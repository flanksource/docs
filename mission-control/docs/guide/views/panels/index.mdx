Panels display aggregated data visualizations above the main table. Each panel runs a SQL query against the view's query results and renders the data as a chart, gauge, or summary.

## Panel Definition

Panels are defined in `spec.panels`:

```yaml
panels:
  - name: Pod Count          # Panel name
    description: Total pods  # Optional description
    type: gauge              # Panel type
    query: SELECT COUNT(*) AS value FROM pods
```

## Common Properties

All panel types support these properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Panel name (required) |
| `description` | string | Optional description |
| `type` | string | Panel type (required) |
| `query` | string | SQL query against view data (required) |
| `gauge`, `number`, `piechart`, `bargauge`, `timeseries` | object | Type-specific options |
