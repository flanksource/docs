Actions define what operations a subject can perform on the target objects. The `actions` field is required and accepts a list of action strings.

## Available Actions

| `read` | Allows reading/viewing resources |
| `write` | Allows creating or modifying resources |
| `delete` | Allows deleting resources |
| `playbook:run` | Allows running playbooks |
| `playbook:approve` | Allows approving playbook runs that require approval |
| `playbook:cancel` | Allows canceling playbook runs |

## Wildcards

You can use wildcards to grant multiple permissions at once:

| Wildcard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `playbook:*` | Grants all playbook-related permissions (run, approve, cancel) |
| `*` | Grants all permissions (use with caution) |
