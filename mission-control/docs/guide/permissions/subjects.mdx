Subjects define WHO or WHAT gets the permission. The `subject` field can contain **only one** of the following:

## Individual User

Specify a human user by their email address or name (if the name is unique) to grant permission.

```yaml
subject:
  person: jane.doe@example.com
```

OR

```yaml
subject:
  person: "Jane Doe"
```

## Team

Specify a team by its name to grant permission to all its members.

```yaml
subject:
  team: sre-team
```

## Group

Specify a defined [Permission Group](./groups) to grant permission. Groups bundle different items (like specific playbooks, notifications) or lists of users/teams.

```yaml
subject:
  group: system-administrators
```

## System Services

Sometimes, a specific system service needs permission to act *for* a particular resource instance. Mission Control often uses this for automation or to allow one part of Mission Control to interact with another. The service gains permission only when it acts for the specified resource, identified by its `<namespace>/<name>`.

### Notification Service

Specify a notification to grant permission to the notification service when it processes that notification.
Example: A notification might need access to read a connection or trigger a playbook run.

```yaml
subject:
  notification: monitoring/critical-alerts
```

### Playbook Service

Specify a playbook to grant permission to the playbook runner service when it runs that playbook.
Example: A playbook needs access to a specific resource it acts on.

```yaml
subject:
  playbook: automation/cleanup-pods
```
