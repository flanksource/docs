## Permissions

Mission Control provides a flexible and strong security model that combines two powerful methods:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

This combined permission system helps you set up detailed access rules.
For instance, while RBAC can control if a user can run any playbooks in the system,
detailed ABAC rules let you define exactly which playbooks specific users or teams can access.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Permission](./permissions/permission) | A rule that grants or denies specific actions to a subject on target objects |
| [Subject](./permissions/subjects) | WHO or WHAT gets the permission (person, team, group, or system service) |
| [Actions](./permissions/actions) | WHAT operations are allowed (read, write, delete, playbook:run, etc.) |
| [Groups](./permissions/groups) | Groups of subjects for easier permission management |

## Access Control Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Roles](./permissions/roles) | Role-Based Access Control using built-in roles (admin, editor, viewer, guest) |
| [ABAC](./permissions/multi-tenancy) | Attribute-Based Access Control based on resource attributes (tags, namespace, name) |
| [Multi-Tenancy](./permissions/multi-tenancy) | Agent and tag-based permissions for SaaS environments |

## Quick Example

```yaml title="permission.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: sre-playbook-access
spec:
  description: Allow SRE team to run playbooks on production configs
  subject:
    team: sre-team
  actions:
    - playbook:run
  object:
    playbooks:
      - name: "*"
    configs:
      - labels:
          environment: production
```

Deny rules always override Allow rules.
