## Permission

In Mission Control, Permission provides a flexible and strong security model that combines two powerful methods:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
This combined permission system helps you set up detailed access rules.
For instance, while RBAC can control if a user can run any playbooks in the system,
detailed ABAC rules let you define exactly which playbooks specific users or teams can access.

You can manage Permissions through the UI and using CRDs.

```yaml title="permission.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/deny-person-playbook.yaml
```

A Permission has 4 parts:

- **Subject**: The user or service requesting access.
- **Object**: The resources this permission affects (playbooks, connections, configs, or components).
- **Effect**: Whether to allow or deny access (Default: allow).
- **Actions**: The [list of allowed actions](/reference/permissions/actions).

:::info
Deny rules always override Allow rules.

## CRD

<Fields
  rows={[
    {
      field: 'description',
      description: 'Description of the permission',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'actions',
      required: true,
      description: 'List of [allowed actions](/reference/permissions/actions)',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
    {
      field: 'subject.person',
      description: 'Email or ID of the person',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'subject.team',
      description: 'Name or ID of the team',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'subject.group',
      description: 'Name of a permission group',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'subject.notification',
      description: '`<namespace>/<name>` of the notification',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'subject.playbook',
      description: '`<namespace>/<name>` of the playbook',
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'object.playbooks',
      description: 'List of playbook resource selectors',
      scheme: 'resourceselectors',
    },
    {
      field: 'object.configs',
      description: 'List of config resource selectors',
      scheme: 'resourceselectors',
    },
    {
      field: 'object.components',
      description: 'List of component resource selectors',
      scheme: 'resourceselectors',
    },
    {
      field: 'object.connections',
      description: 'List of connection resource selectors',
      scheme: 'resourceselectors',
    },
    {
      field: 'deny',
      description: 'Specifies if this is a deny rule. _(Default: False)_',
      scheme: 'bool',
    },
  ]}
/>

Additionally, for [tag-agent based ABAC](./concepts/multi-tenancy.md), you can also use these fields.

<Fields
  rows={[
    {
      field: 'agents',
      description: 'List of agents',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
    {
      field: 'tags',
      description: 'Key-value pairs of tags',
      scheme: '`map[string]string`',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Subjects

Subjects define WHO or WHAT gets the permission. The `subject` field can contain **only one** of the following:

### Individual User

Specify a human user by their email address or name (if the name is unique) to grant permission.

```yaml
subject:
  person: jane.doe@example.com
```

OR

```yaml
subject:
  person: "Jane Doe"
```

### Team

Specify a team by its name to grant permission to all its members.

```yaml
subject:
  team: sre-team
```

### Group

Specify a defined `PermissionGroup` to grant permission. Groups bundle different items (like specific playbooks, notifications) or lists of users/teams.

```yaml
subject:
  group: system-administrators
```

### System Services

Sometimes, a specific system service needs permission to act *for* a particular resource instance. Mission Control often uses this for automation or to allow one part of Mission Control to interact with another. The service gains permission only when it acts for the specified resource, identified by its `<namespace>/<name>`.

- **Notification Service**:

  Specify a notification to grant permission to the notification service when it processes that notification.
  Example: A notification might need access to read a connection or trigger a playbook run.

  ```yaml
  subject:
    notification: monitoring/critical-alerts
  ```

- **Playbook Service**:

  Specify a playbook to grant permission to the playbook runner service when it runs that playbook.
  Example: A playbook needs access to a specific resource it acts on.

  ```yaml
  subject:
    playbook: automation/cleanup-pods
  ```

## Objects

Objects define the resources the permission targets. You can define Objects using [Resource Selectors](/reference/resource-selector).
There are 4 types of objects:

- **Playbooks** - Automation playbooks in the system
- **Configs** - Configuration items in the catalog
- **Connections** - Connection configurations for external systems
- **Components** - Topology components

A permission can target multiple objects, while a subject can only target one.
If you define multiple objects, Mission Control grants the permission only if the request matches all defined objects.
In other words, Mission Control applies an AND condition to the objects.

```yaml file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/deny-person-playbook.yaml {14-16}
```

This permission object allows running all playbooks but **only on configs in the "mission-control" namespace**.

```yaml file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/notification-playbook-permission.yaml {14-22}
```

This permission, on the other hand, allows running the "echo-config" playbook on all configs & components.

## Permission Actions

The following actions can be used in the `actions` field of a Permission:

- **`read`** - Allows reading resources
- **`write`** - Allows creating or modifying resources
- **`delete`** - Allows deleting resources
- **`playbook:run`** - Allows running playbooks
- **`playbook:approve`** - Allows approving playbook runs that require approval
- **`playbook:cancel`** - Allows canceling playbook runs

You can also use wildcards to grant multiple permissions at once:

- **`playbook:*`** - Grants all playbook-related permissions
- **`*`** - Grants all permissions (use with caution)

## Permission Groups

Permission Groups let you group subjects (people, teams, or system services) under one name for simpler permission setup.
The subjects included in the group then inherit the permissions applied to it.

Permission Groups are particularly useful when:
- You need to manage permissions for many users with similar roles
- You want to grant the same permissions to multiple system services
- You need to update permissions for a set of users all at once
