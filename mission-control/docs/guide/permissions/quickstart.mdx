This guide helps you get started with Mission Control permissions, including understanding default permissions and how to customize them.

## Default Behavior

By default, Mission Control operates in a permissive mode where:

- **Editors** can run any playbook and read any connection
- **Notifications** can run any playbook and read configs/components
- **System services** (canaries, scrapers, playbooks, topologies, notifications) can read all connections, configs, and components

This default behavior is suitable for small teams or development environments where fine-grained access control isn't required.

## Enabling Strict Permissions

For production environments or multi-tenant setups, you should enable strict permission mode via Helm values:

```yaml title="values.yaml"
permissions:
  # Require explicit permissions to run playbooks
  playbooks: true
  # Require explicit permissions to read connections
  connections: true
  # Require explicit permissions for system services to read configs
  configs: true
  # Require explicit permissions for system services to read components
  components: true
```

When these are set to `true`, the default permissive rules are disabled and you must explicitly grant permissions.

## Helm Values Reference

| Value | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `permissions.playbooks` | `false` | When `true`, users need explicit permission to run playbooks |
| `permissions.connections` | `false` | When `true`, users need explicit permission to read connections |
| `permissions.configs` | `false` | When `true`, system services need explicit permission to read configs |
| `permissions.components` | `false` | When `true`, system services need explicit permission to read components |

## Default Permission Groups

Mission Control creates a `system` permission group that includes all system services:

```yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: PermissionGroup
metadata:
  name: system
spec:
  canaries:
    - name: "*"
  scrapers:
    - name: "*"
  playbooks:
    - name: "*"
  topologies:
    - name: "*"
  notifications:
    - name: "*"
```

This group is used to grant system-wide permissions to Mission Control's internal services.

## Quick Setup Examples

### Allow a Team to Run Playbooks

```yaml title="team-playbook-permission.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: sre-team-playbooks
spec:
  description: Allow SRE team to run all playbooks
  subject:
    team: sre-team
  actions:
    - playbook:run
  object:
    playbooks:
      - name: "*"
```

### Allow a Notification to Use a Connection

When strict permissions are enabled, notifications need explicit access to connections:

```yaml title="notification-connection-permission.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: alert-notification-slack
spec:
  description: Allow alert notification to use Slack connection
  subject:
    notification: monitoring/critical-alerts
  actions:
    - read
  object:
    connections:
      - name: slack-alerts
```

### Allow a Playbook to Access AWS Connection

```yaml title="playbook-aws-permission.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: cleanup-playbook-aws
spec:
  description: Allow cleanup playbook to use AWS connection
  subject:
    playbook: automation/cleanup-resources
  actions:
    - read
  object:
    connections:
      - name: aws-production
```

### Restrict Access by Namespace

```yaml title="namespace-permission.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: dev-team-dev-namespace
spec:
  description: Allow dev team to run playbooks only in dev namespace
  subject:
    team: developers
  actions:
    - playbook:run
  object:
    playbooks:
      - namespace: development
    configs:
      - namespace: development
```

## Migration from Permissive to Strict Mode

When transitioning to strict permissions:

1. **Audit current usage** - Review which users, teams, and services are running playbooks and accessing connections

2. **Create permissions incrementally** - Start by creating permissions for the most critical workflows:
   ```yaml
   # First, ensure system services still work
   apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
   kind: Permission
   metadata:
     name: system-connections
   spec:
     subject:
       group: system
     actions:
       - read
     object:
       connections:
         - name: "*"
   ```

3. **Enable strict mode one feature at a time**:
   ```yaml title="values.yaml"
   permissions:
     playbooks: true    # Enable first
     connections: false  # Enable after playbook permissions are tested
     configs: false
     components: false
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify that notifications, playbooks, and scrapers continue to function

5. **Monitor for permission errors** - Check logs for access denied errors and create missing permissions

## Common Issues

### Notification Fails to Send

If notifications fail after enabling strict permissions, ensure the notification has read access to any connections it uses:

```yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: notification-connection-access
spec:
  subject:
    notification: <namespace>/<notification-name>
  actions:
    - read
  object:
    connections:
      - name: <connection-name>
```

### Playbook Cannot Access Resources

If a playbook fails with permission errors, grant it access to required connections and configs:

```yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Permission
metadata:
  name: playbook-resource-access
spec:
  subject:
    playbook: <namespace>/<playbook-name>
  actions:
    - read
  object:
    connections:
      - name: <connection-name>
    configs:
      - name: "*"
```
