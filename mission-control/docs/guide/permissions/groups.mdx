Permission Groups let you group subjects (people, teams, or system services) under one name for simpler permission setup.
The subjects included in the group then inherit the permissions applied to it.

Permission Groups are particularly useful when:
- You need to manage permissions for many users with similar roles
- You want to grant the same permissions to multiple system services
- You need to update permissions for a set of users all at once

## Example

```yaml title="permission-group.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/config-notification-group-playbook-permission.yaml
```

## Schema

<Fields
  rows={[
    {
      field: 'name',
      description: 'Set a unique name for the permission group',
      required: true,
      scheme: 'string',
    },
    {
      field: 'people',
      description: 'List of people identifiers (email or id) to associate with the group',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
    {
      field: 'teams',
      description: 'List of team names to associate with the group',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
    {
      field: 'notifications',
      description: 'List of notification `<namespace>/<name>`',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
    {
      field: 'playbooks',
      description: 'List of playbook `<namespace>/<name>`',
      scheme: '`[]string`',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Using Permission Groups

Once a Permission Group is created, you can reference it in the `subject` field of a Permission:

```yaml
subject:
  group: system-administrators
```

All members of the group will inherit the permissions defined in the Permission resource.
