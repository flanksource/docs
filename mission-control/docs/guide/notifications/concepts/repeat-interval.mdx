The repeat interval determines the duration between subsequent related notifications after an initial successful delivery. 

```yaml title="deployment-failed.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: config-updates
  namespace: default
spec:
  events:
    - config.unhealthy
  filter: config.type == "Kubernetes::Deployment"
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
  repeatInterval: 2h
  groupBy:
    - type
  groupByInterval: 12h
```

With the above notification in place, if a Kubernetes Deployment's health fluctuates between `healthy` and `unhealthy` multiple times within a 2-hour window, the system only sends one notification in that period.

### Repeat groups

Repeat interval works in tandem with [notification grouping](./grouping.md).
If multiple notifications fall in the same group, only one notification will be sent for the group within the repeat interval.

#### Example:

Deployment A becomes unhealthy due to a missing storage class, triggering a notification.
Soon after, Deployment B also turns unhealthy for the same reason. Since itâ€™s grouped with A, no additional notification is sent during the repeat interval.
After the 2-hour interval passes, if Deployment C also becomes unhealthy for the same issue, a new notification is sent for C but A & B will also be included in the notification.



| Time   | Deployment | Status     | Action Taken                                       |
|--------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 10:00  | A          | Unhealthy  | Notification sent _(first in group)_                 |
| 10:15  | B          | Unhealthy  | Supressed due to repeat interval _(grouped with A for 12h)_ |
| 12:10  | C          | Unhealthy  | Notification sent _(repeat interval expired)_ Includes A, B, and C in the message _(group is still active since groupByInterval is 12h)_ |
