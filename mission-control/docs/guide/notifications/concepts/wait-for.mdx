Kubernetes clusters and similar dynamic systems may experience temporary discrepancies between the actual and intended state of resources.
For example, a deployment could momentarily appear unhealthy during a scaling operation.
If alerts are configured for `config.unhealthy` events, these transient state fluctuations might lead to an overwhelming number of unnecessary notifications.

To address this issue, you can utilize the waitFor parameter.
This feature allows you to define a delay before sending notifications for specific events.
After an event occurs, the system rechecks its status following the specified wait period. Only if the undesired state persists does a notification trigger.

:::info
`waitFor` is only applicable to notifications of health related events
:::


```yaml title='notify-unhealthy-deployments.yaml' {8}
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: deployment-unhealthy-alerts
spec:
  events:
    - config.unhealthy
  waitFor: 2m
  filter: config.type == 'Kubernetes::Deployment'
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
```

:::warning Handling Scrape Lag

`waitFor` re-evaluates the health based on the current state in config-db. 
However, in some circumstances, there may be a delay between when a change occurs and when it's refelected in config-db,
potentially resulting in false positives.

`waitForEvalPeriod` forces an incremental scrape of the resource before sending a notification.
It waits for up to this period for a scrape to complete before sending a notification.

```yaml title=waitForEvalPeriod.yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: deployment-unhealthy-alerts
spec:
  events:
    - config.unhealthy
  waitFor: 5m
  //highlight-next-line
  waitForEvalPeriod: 30s
```

### Grouping Notifications

Multiple related notifications may be generated within a short time window. Instead of sending each alert separately, 
you can use notification grouping to consolidate multiple events into a single message.

_Example_: When a Kubernetes deployment becomes unhealthy, its replicaset and associated pods will also become unhealthy. 
If you have a notification set up to alert on `config.unhealthy`, you'll receive 3 different notifications at the very least for the same cause.

The `groupBy` parameter allows you to define how notifications should be grouped. 
Grouping can be done via 
- `type` (type of the config)
- `description`
- `status_reason`
- `labels` in the format `labels:app`
- `tags` in the format `tag:namespace`

:::info
Grouping only works with waitFor. 
Hence, a waitFor duration is required
