Kubernetes clusters and similar dynamic systems may experience temporary discrepancies between the actual and intended state of resources.
For example, a deployment could momentarily appear unhealthy during a scaling operation.
If alerts are configured for `config.unhealthy` events, these transient state fluctuations might lead to an overwhelming number of unnecessary notifications.

To address this issue, you can utilize the waitFor parameter.
This feature allows you to define a delay before sending notifications for specific events.
After an event occurs, the system rechecks its status following the specified wait period. Only if the undesired state persists does a notification trigger.
:::info
`waitFor` is only applicable on health related events
:::

This approach helps reduce unnecessary notifications caused by transient state changes, ensuring you're alerted only to persistent issues.


```yaml title='notify-unhealthy-deployments.yaml' {8}
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: deployment-unhealthy-alerts
spec:
  events:
    - config.unhealthy
  waitFor: 2m
  filter: config.type == 'Kubernetes::Deployment'
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
```

:::warning Handling Scrape Lag
`waitFor` re-evaluates the health based on the current state in config-db, in some circumstances there can be a lag between when a change occurs and the state reflects in config-db which can lead to false positives.

`waitForEvalPeriod` forces an incremental scrape of the resource before sending a notification, it waits for up to this period for a scrape to complete before sending a notification.

```yaml title=waitForEvalPeriod.yaml
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: deployment-unhealthy-alerts
spec:
  events:
    - config.unhealthy
  waitFor: 5m
  //highlight-next-line
  waitForEvalPeriod: 30s
```
