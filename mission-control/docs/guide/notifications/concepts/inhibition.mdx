import Inhibition from '../../../reference/notifications/_inhibition.mdx';

Multiple related notifications may be generated within a short time window. Instead of sending each alert separately,
you can use notification inhibition to inhibit notifications based on the resource hierarchy.

_Example_: When a Kubernetes pod becomes unhealthy, its replicaset and the deployment will also become unhealthy.
If you have a notification set up to alert on `config.unhealthy`, you'll receive 3 different notifications for the same cause.
