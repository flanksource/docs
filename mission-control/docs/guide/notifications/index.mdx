# Notifications

Mission Control provides a flexible, event-based notification system that enables filtering and templating of notifications via email, push, slack, teams, etc.

Notifications are triggered by events. An event is a specific occurrence or change in state within the system. For example, notifications can be granular such as a health check failing or a pod crashlooping - or high level based on the health of the system as a whole.


```yaml title="check-failed.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: http-check
  namespace: default
spec:
  events:
    - check.failed
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
```

This notification sends an email to `alerts@acme.com` whenever a health check fails.

<Notification/>


## Templating

You can use Go Templates to customize the content of notification titles and bodies. This allows you to include dynamic information from the event that triggered the notification.

**For example, the following notification definition** uses a Go Template to include the name and health status of the check in the notification title:

```yaml title="notification-template"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
spec:
  events:
    - check.failed
    - check.passed
  title: Check {{.check.name}} is {{.check.health}}
```

In this example `{{.check.name}}` and `{{.check.health}}` are placeholders that gets replaced with the actual values of the `name` and `health` fields from the [check](/reference/canary-checker/check) object associated with the event.

## Filtering Events

Mission Control allows you to fine-tune your notification delivery by filtering events using <CommonLink to="cel">CEL</CommonLink>. This enables you to specify precise conditions that dictate when a notification should be triggered. For instance, you can configure notifications to be sent only for specific event types, specific resources, or when certain conditions are met.

The CEL filters you define have access to the same set of variables as the templates, providing flexibility in defining your filtering criteria. These variables, representing various attributes and properties of the events, empower you to create highly targeted notifications.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where you want to receive notifications exclusively for failed HTTP checks. The following example demonstrates how to achieve this using a CEL filter:

```yaml title="filter-http.yaml"
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: http-alerts
spec:
  events:
    - check.failed
  # Filter for events where the check type is 'http'
  // highlight-next-line
  filter: check.type == 'http'
  to:
    email: alerts@acme.com
```

In this example:

- The `filter` field specifies the CEL expression `check.type == 'http'`.
- This expression evaluates to true only when the `type` attribute of the [check](/reference/canary-checker/check) object is equal to `'http'`.
- So, Mission Control only sends notifications for events that meet this condition, which alerts you when HTTP checks fail.

<details summary="Sophisticated Filters">
For a more sophisticated filter, you can also use the handy [`matchQuery`](/reference/scripting/cel#matchquery) cel function that supports search query.
Example:

```yaml title="config.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/notifications/config-health-match-query.yaml {9}
```

In this example, the filter matches all unhealthy or warning deployments and pods in the prod cluster except for the postgres deployment.

## Triggering Playbooks

Playbooks can be configured as recipients for notifications, allowing you to trigger automated workflows instead of sending notifications to traditional channels like email or Slack. 

While playbooks themselves are capable of listening to events like notifications - this approach leverages the full capabilities of notifications, including:

- Rate Limitation
- Silences
- Repeat Intervals
- WaitFor


```yaml title="playbook-on-unhealthy-configs.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/notifications/health-playbook.yaml

```

This notification above triggers the playbook `mc/echo-config` whenever a config changes its health to the specified list.

#### Permissions

To enable a notification to execute a playbook, the notification must have `playbook:run` permission on the playbook.

The example shows two notifications: `check-alerts` and `homelab-config-health-alerts` which belong to a permission group "config-notifications".
The group has `playbook:run` permission, which both notifications inherit.

```yaml title="permission.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/config-notification-group-playbook-permission.yaml
```
