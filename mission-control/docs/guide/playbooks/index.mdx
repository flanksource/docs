## Playbooks

Playbooks automate common workflows and processes by defining reusable templates of actions that can be triggered on-demand by users, when specific events happen or through webhooks.

Some key benefits include:

* **Accelerated GitOps Adoption** - Use  _"ClickOps"_ to make changes to resources but have them being applied as Git pull requests in the background, enabling non-technical teams to leverage GitOps workflows.
* **Consistency** - Provide easy to discover and reusable templates for common tasks, preventing the complexity of doing the same thing multiple ways.
* **Self-Service** - Enable developers/operators to provision and manage their own resources without involving a central DevOps/Platform team.
* **Compliance** - Improve compliance and security by limiting the need for elevated privileges.
* **Cost Efficiency** - Optimize costs with on-demand environments that spin down after a fixed duration.
* **Portability** - A consistent interface for performing operations irrespective of the underlying infrastructure and/or environment

## Use cases


### Provisioning

### Day 2 Operations

Day 2 operations can be added onto existing resources (`configs`, `components` or health `checks`) using [resource selectors](/reference/resource-selector).

For example scaling a Kubernetes Deployment is only applicable to config items of type: `Kubernetes::Deployment`

```yaml title='scale-deployment.yaml' file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/playbooks/scale-deployment.yaml
```

Before running a playbook, users can provide input using [`parameters`](/reference/playbooks/parameters).
In the playbook above, the user can decide the new number of replicas before running the playbook.


### Just In Time Access

### AIOps

## Actions

Playbooks execute a sequence of actions (steps), these actions can update git repositories, invoke pipelines or run command line tools like `kubectl` and `aws`.

### Templating

The actions values can be templated using [Go Templates](/reference/scripting/gotemplate)

```yaml title="restart-deployment.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  configs:
    - types:
        - Kubernetes::Deployment
  actions:
    - name: 'Restart kubernetes deployment'
      exec:
        //highlight-next-line
        script: kubectl rollout restart deployment {{.config.name}} -n {{.config.tags.namespace}}
```

The parameters to the playbooks are available in the [Context](reference/playbooks/context)

## Approval

Playbooks can require approval before execution by configuring an `approval` block:

```yaml title="approve-kubernetes-scaling.yaml"
#...
kind: Playbook
spec:
  #...
  approval:
    type: any
    approvers:
      people:
        - admin@local
      teams:
        - DevOps
```

| Field       | Description                    | Scheme       | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| `type`      | How many approvals required. Defaults to `all`    | `any` or `all`     | `false`  |
| `approvers.[]people` | Login or id of a person| `People` | `false`  |
| `approvers.[]teams` | Name or id of a team | `Team` | `false`  |

## Permissions

Playbook permissions control who can perform various actions on playbooks.

```yaml title="playbook-permissions.yaml" file=<rootDir>/modules/mission-control/fixtures/permissions/deny-person-playbook.yaml
```

### Required Permissions

To run a playbook, a principal (user, team, or service account) needs:
1. The `playbook:run` permission on the playbook
2. A `read` permission on the resource the playbook targets

For example, to run a playbook that scales a Kubernetes deployment, the principal needs:
- `playbook:run` permission on the scaling playbook
- `read` permission on the target Kubernetes deployment resource

### Permission Types

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `playbook:run` | Run a playbook |
| `playbook:approve` | Approve a playbook run |
| `playbook:cancel` | Cancel a running playbook |

### Permission Inheritance

:::info
When a playbook triggers another playbook, the permissions are evaluated using the playbook's identity, not the original user who initiated the first playbook. 
This means the triggering playbook must have permission to run the target playbook and to read the resources.
