# <Icon name="cpu"/> AI Action

AI Action allows you to integrate AI capabilities into your playbooks by leveraging the rich context that Mission Control maintains about your infrastructure. When executed against configs or components, the AI action automatically injects:

- Component/config manifests and specifications
- Related configurations with configurable relationship depth
- Historical analysis data within the specified time period
- Change history across related infrastructure within defined time ranges

This comprehensive context enables AI models to provide more informed analysis and insights about your infrastructure state and relationships.
For example, when a Kubernetes pod fails, it examines the pod spec, ConfigMap changes, service logs together, revealing patterns that single-component analysis might overlook.

### Context provider playbook

These playbooks are executed concurrently and their output is used as context for the AI action.
If any of these playbooks fail, it does not affect the execution of the main playbook -
 the AI action will continue with whatever context is available from the successful playbooks.

<Fields rows={[
  {field: "namespace", description: "Namespace of the playbook", scheme: "string", required: true},
  {field: "name", description: "Name of the playbook", scheme: "string", required: true},
  {field: "if", description: "If is a CEL expression that decides if this playbook should be included in the context", scheme: "cel"},
  {field: "params", description: "Parameters to pass to the playbook", scheme: "map[string]string"}
]}/>

### Relationship

The AI Action can maintain relationships with other elements:

<Fields rows={[
 {
   field: "depth",
   description: "Depth of the relationship",
   scheme: "int"
 },
 {
   field: "direction",
   description: "Direction of the relationship",
   scheme: "`all` | `incoming` | `outgoing`"
 },
 {
   field: "changes.since",
   description: "Select the changes of the related resources to feed into the AI",
   scheme: "duration"
 },
 {
   field: "analysis.since",
   description: "Select the analysis of the related resources to feed into the AI",
   scheme: "duration"
 }
]}/>

### Artifacts

When Mission Control has a configured artifact store, the AI Action automatically stores its prompts as artifacts. These artifacts are:

* Available in the Playbook Runs page
* Downloadable for reference and analysis
