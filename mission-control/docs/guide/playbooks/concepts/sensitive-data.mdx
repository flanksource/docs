Sensitive data includes passwords, API keys, tokens, and other confidential information that requires protection from unauthorized access or exposure. Mission Control provides comprehensive protection for sensitive data throughout the entire playbook lifecycle.

## Secret Parameters

Use `secret` type parameters to handle sensitive data in playbooks:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: database_password
    type: secret
    label: "Database Password"
    description: "Password for database connection"
    required: true
```

## KMS Connection

:::info
Your Mission Control instance **must** have a KMS connection configured to use secret parameters. 
:::

Configure this using the `--secret-keeper-connection` flag:

```bash
mission-control serve --secret-keeper-connection "connection://default/my-kms-key"
```

or in the helm chart:

```yaml
kmsConnection: "connection://default/my-kms-key"
```

Supported connection types:
- AWS KMS
- Azure Key Vault  
- GCP KMS
