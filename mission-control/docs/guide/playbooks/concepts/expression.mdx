Playbook event filters use [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-go).

> The Common Expression Language (CEL) is a non-Turing complete language designed for simplicity, speed, safety, and portability. CEL's C-like syntax is similar to expressions in C++, Go, Java, and TypeScript.

**Examples:**

```yaml title="notify-with-filter.yaml"
---
apiVersion: mission-control.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Playbook
metadata:
  name: notify-with-filter
spec:
  on:
    config:
      - event: created
  configs:
    - type: Kubernetes::Pod
  actions:
    - name: Send notification
      exec:
        script: notify-send "{{.config.name}} was created"
    - name: Bad script to create a failing action
      exec:
        script: non-existing-command
    - name: Send all success notification
      if: success() # this filter practically skips this action as the second action above always fails
      exec:
        script: notify-send "Everything went successfully"
    - name: Send notification regardless
      if: always()
      exec:
        script: notify-send "a config was created"
```

## Conditionally running actions

Playbook actions can be conditionally executed using CEL expressions. These expressions must return a `bool` value (return `false` to skip the action).

Expressions support the following functions in addition to the standard <CommonLink to="cel">CEL</CommonLink> functions.

| Function    | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `always()`  | Execute regardless of playbook state (cancelled/failed)      |
| `failure()` | Execute if any previous actions failed                       |
| `skip()`    | Skip execution of this action                               |
| `success()` | Execute only if all previous actions succeeded (default)     |
| `timeout()` | Execute only if any previous actions timed out               |


**Examples**

- `if: config.deleted_at ? true: false`
- `if: always()`

## Context

Expressions have access to the following variables and functions:

| Field | Description | Schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | Configuration object passed to the playbook | [`ConfigItem`](/reference/config-db) |
| `component` | Component object passed to the playbook | [`Component`](/reference/topology/components) |
| `check` | Canary Check object passed to the playbook | [`Check`](/reference/canary-checker/check) |
| `params` | User-provided parameters for the playbook | `map[string]string` |
| `user.id` | Unique identifier of the user who triggered the action | `string` |
| `user.name` | Full name of the user who triggered the action | `string` |
| `user.email` | Email address of the user who triggered the action | `string` |
| `action.name` | Name of the current action | `string` |
| `action.status` | Current status of the action (`scheduled`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `skipped`, or `cancelled`) | `string` |
| `action.scheduled_time` | Timestamp when the action was scheduled | `string` |
| `action.start_time` | Timestamp when the action execution began | `string` |

For playbooks triggered via webhooks, the following additional fields are available:
<Fields
rows={[
{
field: 'request.url',
description: `Endpoint of the webhook. Example \`/playbook/webhook/test-webhook\``,
    scheme: 'string'
  },
  {
    field: 'request.headers',
    description: `Headers sent on the webhook request`,
    scheme: '`map[string]string`'
  },
  {
    field: 'request.params',
    description: `Query parameters sent on the webhook request`,
    scheme: '`map[string]string`'
  },
  {
    field: 'request.content',
    description: `Content sent on the webhook request`,
    scheme: 'string'
  },
  {
    field: 'request.json',
    description: `JSON content if the webhook content is JSON`,
    scheme: '`map[string]any`',
}
]} />
