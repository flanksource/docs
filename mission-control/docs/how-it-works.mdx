## Configuration Approach

Mission Control manages configuration primarily through Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). While a postgres database serves as the ultimate source of truth, Kubernetes operators ensure continuous synchronization between the CRDs and the database.  By using the database as the source of truth Mission Control provides the best of both worlds.

CRD's are great for:

* GitOps
* Decentralizing configuration, reducing the need for teams to coordinate
* Bundling health checks, topologies into application Helm charts
* Secure lookup of secret values

Layering the database on top enables:

* High performance - ETCD is optimized for consistency over performance, while mission control works well with eventually consistent configuration
* Escape hatches to create configuration via a UI/API

:::warning Mixing CRDs and UI Editing
Configuration created by CRD's is readonly from the UI/API. You can mix and match at the configuration item level, but cannot change the mode once created.

Mission Control uses Kubernetes Custom Resources Definitions as the underlying configuration method. The CRD's include:
