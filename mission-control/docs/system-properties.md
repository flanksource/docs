# Log Levels

# Debug & Trace

Debug and trace settings are different to debug and trace log levels. Log levels are used for general service output - The log volume scales with functionality, not with data. Debug and trace on the otherhand are defined on individual objects e.g. Canaries, Scrapers, Playbooks etc and scale with data volumes. Resource level debug/trace usually have the resource name/id as a prefix
