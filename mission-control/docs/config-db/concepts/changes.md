# Changes

When you save a config item to ConfigDB, it also tracks its changes. These changes may come from external sources like Kubernetes events or Azure activities. Alternatively, they can be automatically detected by comparing the old config with the newly changed one.

## Types

Changes are of two types

- Diff change
- Event based change

### Diff Change

These are changes generated by ConfigDB by simply comparing the old and new config values. The image below shows a change where the port value was modified from 8080 to 3000.

### Event based change

These are changes provided by an external source example: Kubernetes Events & AWS CLoudtrail. Event based changes have a type associated to it.

## Change Transformation

You can transform a change before it's saved to the database.

| Field     | Description                                                                   | Scheme                                      | Required | Templatable |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `mapping` | Mapping is a list of CEL expressions that maps a change to the specified type | [_`[]ChangeMapping`_](#mapping)             |          |             |
| `exclude` | Select what changes to exclude                                                | <CommonLink to="cel">_`[]CEL`_</CommonLink> |          | `true`      |

### Exclusions

Some configs can have changes in high volume that may not be relevant. Example: A kubernetes Node config changes frequently as the pods in the cluster update their images. From the node's perspective the image changes are irrelevant.

This is where exclusions can become handy. Here's an example that ignore all image changes in a kubernetes node config:

```yaml title="kubernetes-scraper.yaml"
apiVersion: configs.flanksource.com/v1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-scraper
spec:
  kubernetes:
    - clusterName: local-kind-cluster
      transform:
        changes:
          exclude:
            - 'config_type == "Kubernetes::Node" && details.message == "status.images"'
```

### Mapping

When you encounter a diff change, unlike an event based change, it can sometimes appear cryptic. The summary of the change may not immediately indicate what the change is about. For example, the change 'status.images' might not be self-explanatory. To address this issue, we can assign types to these diff changes using mapping.

```yaml title="kubernetes-scraper.yaml"
apiVersion: configs.flanksource.com/v1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-scraper
spec:
  kubernetes:
    - clusterName: local-kind-cluster
      transform:
        changes:
          mapping:
            - filter: >
                change.change_type == 'diff' && change.summary == "status.containerStatuses" &&
                patch != null && has(patch.status) && has(patch.status.containerStatuses) &&
                patch.status.containerStatuses.size() > 0 &&
                has(patch.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount)
              type: PodCrashLooping
            - filter: >
                change.change_type == 'diff' && change.summary == "status.images" && config.kind == "Node"
              type: ImageUpdated
```

| Field     | Description                          | Scheme                                    | Required |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `filter`  | Selects changes to apply the mapping | <CommonLink to="cel">_`CEL`_</CommonLink> | `true`   |
| `exclude` | Type to be set on the change         | `string`                                  | `true`   |

#### Template Variables

| Field         | Description               | Scheme                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `config_type` | Type of the config        | `string`                                       |
| `config`      | Access the scraped config | [`ScrapedResult`](../references/scrape-result) |

## Change Retention

Changes can quickly accumulate and grow large over time. While it's important to retain some changes, others can be discarded after a period. Retention enables you to discard changes based on their type.

Example: The scraper config below only retains one week of PullSuceeded changes.

```yaml title="kubernetes-scraper.yaml"
apiVersion: configs.flanksource.com/v1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-scraper
spec:
  retention:
    changes:
      - name: PullSuceeded
        age: 7d # Only keep one week of PullSuceeded changes
  kubernetes:
    clusterName: local
```

| Field   | Description                                             | Scheme   | Required |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| `name`  | Name of the change type                                 | `string` | `true`   |
| `age`   | Maximum age of the change type to retain (`12h`, `30d`) | `string` |          |
| `count` | Maximum count to retain the change type                 | `int`    |          |
