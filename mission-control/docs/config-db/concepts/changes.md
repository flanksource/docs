title: Changes

When you save a config item to ConfigDB, it also tracks its changes. These changes may come from external sources like Kubernetes events or Azure activities. Alternatively, they can be automatically detected by comparing the old config with the newly changed one.

Changes are of two types

- Diff change
- Event based change

### Diff Change

These are changes generated by ConfigDB by simply comparing the old and new config values. The image below shows a change where the port value was modified from 8080 to 3000.

### Event based change

These are changes provided by an external source example: Kubernetes Events & AWS CLoudtrail. Event based changes have a type associated to it.
