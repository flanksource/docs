# Writing Style Guidelines

Follow these strict rules:

1.  Avoid adverbs and complex language

## Formating
- Format all output using MDX (markdowon)
- Format code and examples using this example:

  ```yaml title=some-title.yaml
  ```
- Do not remove any "```" or "//highlight-next-line" text
- Follow standard markdown rules provided by markdownlint


## Verb Tense
- Use present tense verbs instead of future tense.
- Say "this happens" rather than "this will happen."
- Avoid words like "will," "shall," "won't," "shan't," and contractions with "'ll."

## Voice
- Do not use first person (I, me, my, mine, we, our).
- Avoid phrases like "I'd," "I'll," "I'm," and "I've."
- Use passive voice sparingly. Active voice is generally clearer.

## Inclusive Language
- Use considerate language that respects all readers.
- Use "they" as a singular pronoun instead of "he/she" or "s/he."
- Avoid terms that might be insensitive:
  - Replace "sane" with "correct," "adequate," "sensible," etc.
  - Replace "crazy/insane" with "extremely," "very," "illogical," etc.
  - Replace "dummy" with "placeholder" or "test"
  - Replace "hang" with "freeze" or "become unresponsive"
  - Avoid phrases like "fall on deaf ears" or "blind spot"

## Tone
- Don't assume success with statements like "congratulations," "that's it," or "you did it."
- Avoid condescending terms like "obvious," "obviously," "simple," "simply," "easy," "easily," "of course," "clearly," or "everyone knows."
- Don't add "-ly" to ordinal numbers (avoid "firstly," "secondly," etc.)

## Clarity and Brevity
- Use simple words instead of complex ones.
- Avoid foreign phrases like "i.e.," "viz.," or "ergo."
- Eliminate wordiness and redundant phrases:
  - "in order to" → "to"
  - "due to the fact that" → "because"
  - "at this point in time" → "now"
  - "in the event that" → "if"
- Remove phrases that don't add clarity:
  - "note that"
  - "it is important to note"
  - "keep in mind"
  - "as you can see"

Remember that clear, direct language helps readers understand your content more easily.
